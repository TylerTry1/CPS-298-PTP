Hello, my name is Tyler Auten, I am 19 years old and turn 20 in October. My current major is Programming in Java, but my heart truly lies in video editing. 
This will be my last semester here at WCC for my associates degree. 
I currently work at an ice cream shop as a assistant manager, and have been working there for about 5 years in total. 
My hobbies include video games, anime, and video editing.
