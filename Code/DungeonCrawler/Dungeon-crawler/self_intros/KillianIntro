Hello everyone! My name is Killian, she/her or they/them pronouns. I'm attending WCC pursuing an Associate in Information Systems in C++, and assuming this semester goes well it will be my last for the degree! 
I love everything coding and tech, I play a lot of video games, tabletop roleplaying games such as Dungeons and Dragons. I love playing music and reading, and enjoy running! 
I believe my communication strengths are being patient and open minded to others ideas, and my weakness is primarily second guessing myself due to anxiety. 
I hope to continue expanding my knowledge of C++ and refining both the process of coding and the quality of my code. Online classes work best for me because they allow me to balance school, work and personal life the best as I have a rather sporadic schedule.  
I look forward to learning with everyone this semester!
