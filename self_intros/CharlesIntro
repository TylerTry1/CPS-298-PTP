Hey guys! My name is Charles Hunt and this will by my final semester at WCC for my associates
degree. I have no idea what I am going to do after I finish but it will open new options.
I would love to expand my knowledge of coding to different languages but more at my own pace.
Outside of school, I play a lot of disc golf and compete in roughly 20 tournaments each year.
This will be my first time working with a team while programming so I look forward to the experience!
